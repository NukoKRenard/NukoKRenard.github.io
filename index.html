                I am a senior year High School student at 
                <a href="https://schoolweb.tdsb.on.ca/cedarbraeci">Cedarbrae Colligate Institute</a>
                , hoping to build a career and a game
                studio. I have experience with programming, and illustration, and specialise
                in graphics programming and GPU work. I hope that my creations will bring
                meaning to those who use them. I am also a 6 year Air Cadet who is a member of the
                Advanced Leadership Program. I have experience being a teacher and mentor, and an able
                to supervise and lead a team.

                                Their ships can be recognized by their flying wing shape, and their

                                This is a small fractal shader I made for phone backgrounds.
                                It uses the mandlebrot set and some math to generate the colors.

                                This is a shader that uses a rendering technique called raymarching
                                as well as a softmin function to render some deforming blobs. Like the
                                fractals it was made to be a wallpaper for phones. The hightlight on the
                                balls also move in accordance with the phone's rotation.

                                This is a game I made from scratch using pygame with python. All of the models, shaders, textures, sound, and effects
                                (everything in the game) is authored by me. This was originally made for a school project, but I did far more than I had to
                                learning OpenGL and 3D rendering in order to make it.
